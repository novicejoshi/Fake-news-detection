Fake News Detection. 

This is a python project that uses Machine Learning algorithm to give the accuracy of the news content given. As of now, We have tried on 2 datasets and on the one of them we tried changing articles and training the module multiple times. As per our observation, Adding large dataset is resulting high accuracy. 

##Running the project.

1) Import all the necessary packages. 
2) Extract the data sets to a location and update the same in the code. 
3) Accuracy can be improved by changing/using multiple datasets
